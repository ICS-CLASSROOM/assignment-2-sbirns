A naive method for determining whether two documents are similar is to treat them as collections of words (bag of words) and use the number of words they share as a proxy for their similarity. It makes sense that two books with religion as the topic (e.g.  `398.txt` and `3296.txt`) would have more words in common than a book that discusses religion and a book that discusses science fiction (e.g. books `84.txt` and `398.txt`). \n",
